# Welcome to Visiativ's organization on GitHub where we love all things open source.

## What we are

Visiativ is a strategic partner who accelerates digital transformation of SMEs and micro-enterprises. We offer solutions that foster innovation, optimise customer/supplier relationships, and improve the exchange of information and knowledge.

The advantage of Visiativ Solutions Switzerland is that we can offer a wide range of products, as we are not only a reseller of SOLIDWORKS solutions, but also of the entire 3DEXPEPERIENCE product range. In addition to engineering and design solutions based on CAD, we also enable safe and efficient manufacturing processes through the distribution of CAM software solutions. The group also develops its own range of applications to simplify our customers' work processes.

The Visiativ Group is represented by three agencies in German- and French-speaking Switzerland, and also has offices in ten countries - on three different continents (Africa, America and Europe) - with more than 21.000 customers.
